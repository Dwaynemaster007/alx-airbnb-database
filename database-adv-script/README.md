# Advanced Database Queries for ALX Airbnb

## Project: Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on advanced SQL concepts, query optimization, and database performance tuning. The scripts contained here demonstrate proficiency in complex joins, subqueries, aggregation, window functions, and performance analysis.

### Files

* `joins_queries.sql`: Contains queries that use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and a `FULL OUTER JOIN` workaround to retrieve data across multiple tables.
* `subqueries.sql`: Contains queries that demonstrate the use of both non-correlated and correlated subqueries for data filtering and analysis.
* `aggregations_and_window_functions.sql`: Contains queries that use `COUNT` with `GROUP BY` for data aggregation and `RANK()` and `ROW_NUMBER()` window functions to rank data.
* `database_index.sql`: Contains SQL commands to create indexes and uses `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to measure the performance improvement.
* `index_performance.md`: A report detailing the performance analysis of indexing.
* `perfomance.sql`: Contains a complex query and its refactored version, demonstrating how to optimize performance.
* `optimization_report.md`: A report on the optimization strategy and observed performance improvements for complex queries.
* `partitioning.sql`: Contains SQL commands to implement table partitioning and a query to test its performance.
* `partition_performance.md`: A report on the performance benefits of using table partitioning.
* `performance_monitoring.md`: A report documenting the process of monitoring query performance and making targeted schema adjustments.

### How to Use

1.  Connect to your database client.
2.  Navigate to the `database-adv-script` directory.
3.  Execute the queries and commands in the respective files against the corresponding Airbnb database schema.
